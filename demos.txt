Welcome to JGroups !
********************

Please read the README.md file for detailed instructions on how to run
the demos.

The following demos can be run (run them in multiple containers):

* chat.sh [-name name] [-props JGroups config file] [-a] [-b bucket] [-r region]

* lock.sh [-name name] [-props JGroups config file] [-a] [-b bucket] [-r region]

* count.sh [-name name] [-props JGroups config file] [-a] [-b bucket] [-r region]

-a: run on AWS (triggers a scrips to fetch the external address of the EC2 instance)
-b: the S3 bucket name; used in aws.xml when fetching information about other cluster members
    on startup

probe.sh can be used to inspect the running cluster nodes on the host.

Questions can be asked on the users or dev mailing lists:
https://sourceforge.net/p/javagroups/mailman.

Enjoy !

Bela Ban
